## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed solution
For this app idea it consist of key features include present-day climate advisory, sowing time suggestions, water requirement estimation, and automated watering reminders. The app also offers pest and disease detection through image analysis, market price tracking for crops, and timely rain alerts.It also has the step to create natural fertilizers based on type of crop. To enhance usability, it includes a voice assistant, multilingual support for diverse user groups, and crop damage recovery suggestions. With dynamic web pages and AI for user friendly environment , the app fulfills the farmer with all required agricultural needs.

## Technical Approach
To implement the proposed smart farming assistant app ,we can use it AI . The frontend will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For multilingual support and accessibility Google Translate API will be used. The backend will be created by Python using  Django or Node.js (with Express.js).for heavy data application postgressql can be used. Voice assistant features will be enabled through platforms like Google Dialogflow or Amazon Alexa SDK. Weather and market data will be collected using APIs like OpenWeatherMap and government agriculture portals, while Firebase Cloud Messaging will handle push notifications for rain alerts and reminders. The app will be hosted on cloud platforms such as AWS or Google Cloud. ensuring scalability and reliabilityy.

## Feasibility and Viability
This app is both technically feasible and economically viable,. With scalable technologies like React, Python, cloud platforms, the app can be developed and deployed efficiently. The weather data, market prices, and image-based pest detection is achievable using existing features  and machine learning tools. Moreover, the app’s multilingual and voice-enabled makes the farmers ,user friendly to access, making the harvested crops to reach the market on correct time. In conclusions this dynamic web app holds strong potential for long-term impact and sustainability.

## Impact and Benefits
This app has the potential to transform agricultural practices by making farmers with timely, stuff of work. It enhances decision-making through climate advisories, pest detection, and market price tracking, leading to improved crop yield and reduced losses.It can be dealed with society with multilingual and voice-enabled features, especially benefiting rural communities. Economically, it helps farmers by using resources like water and fertilizers, while enabling better market engagement. Environmentally, the app encourages sustainable farming by reducing over-irrigation and chemical fertilizers. Overall, it supports a  efficient farming environment.

## Research and References
I used simple and trusted websites to collect useful information for this farming app. For weather updates, I referred to Openweathermap. To check crop market prices, I used Agmarknet, a government site. For farming tips and research, I looked at ICAR, which is the india’s top agriculture research center.
